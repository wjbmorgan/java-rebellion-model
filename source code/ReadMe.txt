How to use this model:
1. Compile.
2. Execute Test.java, input initial parameters in console in given order: 
   agentProbability(int), copProbability(int), vision(double),
   governmentLegitimacy(double), maxJailTime(int), agentMovable(boolean)
   seperated by a single space.
   (for example: "70 4 7 0.82 30 true")
3. Run the model.
4. After simulation when "Done" shows, the data has been output to default location as a single .csv file.
   The default location is E:\ and the file is named after initial parameters.
   (for example: "E:\70_4_7.0_0.82_30_true.csv")
5. Use Microsoft Excel or other software to retrieve data and show results.
